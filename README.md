# GrpcSever-Client-Microservice
In this repository, I developed the Product Grpc project as a Microservice. 
This is Asp.Net gRPC Server Web Application and exposes APIs for Product CRUD operations.
in this project, we have a Grpc Server and a Grpc Client that can make communication together by the http2 protocol.
